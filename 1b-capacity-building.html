                      legal, IT, end users, budgeting and procurement professionals. Who owns the process? Transitioning
                      to cross-departmental protocols and standards requires process change management that is
                      independent of the implicated departments.

                  Several individuals, departments and agencies need to build or adapt their existing norms and
                  processes in order to effectively support software procurement. That will mean building new skills,
                  shifting day to day tasks, and creating new processes and templates. Procurement should involve:
                  digital or IT; any number of direct service delivery departments (for example traffic and parking);
                  procurement; budgeting or accounting; and legal.

                  A great way to reach out to many individuals across different departments is to host a workshop or
                  lunch-and-learn session. Here, you can share the basics of procurement and software development.
                  Demystify the process, answer questions, and debunk preconceptions. Emphasize the primary
                  objective—acquiring better products and services—and the positive outcomes that can arise from
                  reconfiguring procurement—simplicity, efficiency, and creative solution development.

                  A great way to reach out to many individuals across different departments is to host a workshop or
                  lunch-and-learn session. Here, you can share the basics of procurement and software development.
                  Demystify the process, answer questions, and debunk preconceptions. Emphasize the primary
                  objective—acquiring better products and services—and the positive outcomes that can arise from
                  reconfiguring procurement—simplicity, efficiency, and creative solution development.
